            with a B.Tech. in Electronics and Telecommunication (8.54 CGPA),
            where I developed a solid analytical mindset and problem-solving
            skills. Despite my background in electronics, my passion for
            creating innovative web solutions led me to pursue a career in

            challenging projects that have significantly improved my technical
            capabilities. My role involves developing and optimizing web
            applications, where I've successfully improved application
            performance and user experience. The dynamic environment has allowed

            My journey into web development started in 2023, where I immersed
            myself in learning modern development practices. What began as
            curiosity quickly evolved into passion as I discovered the creative
            possibilities in building interactive and efficient web
            applications. Through hands-on experience and continuous learning,
            I've developed a comprehensive understanding of full-stack
            development, always staying current with the latest industry trends
            and best practices.
